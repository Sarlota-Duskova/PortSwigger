# SQL injection

### SQL (Structured Query Language)
It is web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database. In many cases, an attacker can modify or delete this data, causing persistent changes to the app content or behavior.

**SQL injection examples:**

- Retrieving hidden data = modify an SQL query to return additional results
- Subverting application logic = change a query to interfere with the applications logic
- UNION attacks = retrieve (z√≠skat) data from different database tables
- Examining the database = extract information about the version and structure of the database
- Blind SQL injection = result of a query you control are not returned in the applications responses
